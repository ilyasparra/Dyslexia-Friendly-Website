## Ilyas Parra's Dyslexia Friendly Website
Contains personal website using javascript, HTML, and CSS for audiences struggling with Dyslexia. 
This is a personal project for me because I have a family member with dyslexia. Furthermore, I have prior work experience with children who have dyslexia as well.
